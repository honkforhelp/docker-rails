# Open a PR with your changes

Don't scope creep this repo too much

# Tag Releses as Semver versions (see: http://semver.org/)

examples: 0.1.0, 1.2.1, 2.0.0

Increment Release tags like you would any other semver versioned project.

Releases should not break the basic functionality of the image

Releases that make shifts to the prime functionality (new ruby version, new node major version, etc.) should bump the Major version number of the release
